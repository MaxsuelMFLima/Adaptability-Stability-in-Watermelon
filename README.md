# Adaptability Stability in Watermelon

This repository presents the data and scripts that support the research published in the journal CBAB - http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1984-70332026v26n2a17.

# Database

The file _data.txt_ contains the raw data used in the analysis described in the article. The column labeled AMB represents the environments (12 evaluated); GEN indicates the genotype (15 evaluated); BLO represents the block or repetition (3 for each genotype in each of the environments). The variable of interest evaluated was Yield (PROD).

# Script for analysis

This script implements classical and Bayesian methods for adaptability and stability analysis in multi-environment trials, following Toler (1998).
The file "_script_adap_stab_WM.ipynb_" shows the script used to perform the inferences.

### Objective

This script performs adaptability and stability analysis in multi-environment trials using:

- Classical ANOVA (Randomized Complete Block Design across environments)
- Iterative frequentist estimation of environmental index (Toler method)
- Bayesian inference using PyMC
- Stability parameter (S²d) computation

The method is suitable for genotype × environment experiments.

### Workflow

The analysis is performed in the following steps:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Classical ANOVA (to obtain QMR and CV%)
3. Iterative estimation of environmental index (frequentist method)
4. Bayesian inference (linear model with common beta)
5. Bayesian inference (segmented model)
6. Stability parameter (S²d) computation
7. Graphical output of genotype response curves

### Input Data Format

The dataset must contain the following columns:

- AMB  → Environment
- GEN  → Genotype
- BLO  → Block (replication)
- PROD → Yield (response variable)

The design assumes a randomized complete block design within each environment.

### ANOVA Model

Y_ijk = μ + A_j + G_i + (GA)_ij + B_k(A_j) + ε_ijk

Where:
- A_j = environment effect
- G_i = genotype effect
- GA_ij = genotype × environment interaction
- B_k(A_j) = block within environment
- ε_ijk = experimental error

### Bayesian Segmented Model (Toler, 1998)

For each genotype:

Y_ij = α_i + β1_i μ_j^- + β2_i μ_j^+ + ε_ij

Where:
- μ_j is the environmental index
- μ_j^- = μ_j if μ_j ≤ 0
- μ_j^+ = μ_j if μ_j > 0
- ε_ij ~ Normal(0, σ²)

### Stability Parameter (S²d)

S²d = (QMD_i × r − QMR) / r

Where:
- QMD_i = mean square deviation from regression
- QMR = residual mean square from global ANOVA
- r = number of replications

QMR is obtained from the classical ANOVA model.

### Requirements

Python 3.10+

Required packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- pymc
- arviz
  
### How to Run

1. Adjust the file path in the data loading section.
2. Run cells sequentially:
   - Data loading
   - ANOVA
   - Frequentist parameter estimation
   - Bayesian Step 1
   - Bayesian Step 2
3. Results will be saved in:
   /bayesian_adaptability_toler_step2/

### Important Notes

- The notebook must be executed sequentially.
- QMR_global and r are computed only once and reused.
- The data must contain replication within environments.
- The model assumes balanced design.
